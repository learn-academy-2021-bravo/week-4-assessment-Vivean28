# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: From my understanding, instance variable is conected to the the to the main class it ruby for example, if Apple is the main class name then the instance variable would be conected yo that class. Ex saying somthing = Apple.new.

  Instance variable is different from other variables because it must be connected to the main class where other variable do not have to be connected.


  Researched answer: An instance variable dose belong to it's class and an example of this can be let's saty we have class called Cats, then the instance variable would be what kind of cat it and example of this would be @small_cat, @medium_cat, @large_cat and all this would go inside of the do and end. The diffrence between instance variable and other variables, is that the instance variable is private to it's(do and end) or in a method would be def and end. where other vaiable are not.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: A block in Ruby is anything that goes inside of it's block meaning inside of the (class and end)

  Researched answer: Ruby blocks are anonymous functions that can be passed into methods, these methods are anything that iether goes inside of a do and end or inside of curlies {}. When using the blocks for only one line it would be okay to use curlies {}, where if I have more than one line then I must use the do and end. 



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: An implicit return means we do not have to write rtuen in the block, eventhough there is no word return there it actullay will return it automatically 

  Researched answer: An implicit return is an automatic return to the ruby in the end so it it will return the last line eventhough wwe don't call it.



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: I belive object-oriented programming means that the language is all made of objects examlpe, variables, arrays and objects. From what I understand, functional would be how the user'sinteraction is.

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming is a way to program using objects and those objects can have many data in the them and we can also adde the the data so we could chage the state of the data. Where on the other hand Functional programming is different because here we would not change the data on of the program it's state would and should be the same.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is what holds the object (the blue print for the object). An Object is a collection of data  taht is nested in one vaialbe in a way. They both could be accessed with the dot notation.

  Researched answer: A class is a blueprint for the object, it defines all the properties that the object in going to have but is doesn't actually do anything because it is just a place holder for the information. An object is where all the details are so in the object is where we can do things like getting the information from.



6. STRETCH: What is `attr_accessor`?

  Your answer: attr_accessor is what we use in Ruby and give it place holders that way we can later use them in our program.

  Researched answer: attr_accessor allows us to get and set the instance variables so it creates instance variables.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system.
 
2. Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails is a very popular open-source web application framework.

3. CRUD: Standes for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are the four basic functions that models should be able to do,  very offten.

4. ORM: Is a way that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm

5. Active Record:Active Record is the M in MVC.

Active Records are used in Ruby as a way of holdeing date so that it can be recalled for later use even after we've closed the program that created the data.
